/**
 * AWS Regions and Endpoints
 * <p>
 * To reduce data latency in your applications, most Amazon Web Services offer a
 * regional endpoint to make your requests. An endpoint is a URL that is the
 * entry point for a web service. For example,
 * https://dynamodb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com is an entry point for the Amazon
 * DynamoDB service.
 * <p>
 * Some services, such as IAM, do not support regions; therefore, their
 * endpoints do not include a region. Some services, such as Amazon EC2, let you
 * specify an endpoint that does not include a specific region, for example,
 * https://ec2.amazonaws.com. In that case, AWS routes the endpoint to
 * us-east-1.
 * <p>
 * If a service supports regions, the resources in each region are independent.
 * For example, if you create an Amazon EC2 instance or an Amazon SQS queue in
 * one region, the instance or queue is independent from instances or queues in
 * another region.
